                            The name is Abdulkadir, Abdulkadir Abdulkadir... Yeah that is right, I
                            have the same first name and surname. Anyways, I am a 22 year old Mechanical
                            Engineering student currently studying for my MEng. Although I am studying 
                            mechanical engineering, I do not like to put in a box. I have started to learn
                            how to program and am dedicated to improve and master the art of coding! I 
                            enjoy coding and am looking to make it a career path. I know as a mechanical 
                            engineer I am already at a disadvantage, however I possess skills an engineer 
                            has that your typical computer scientist does not have. Also, I will do what ever it takes to become the best I can at programming. I will 
                            one day become a Software Engineer, God willing. As for now, I will be working on various projects 
                            and taking many courses to build up my knowledge and skills, like this website right here. Anyways, 
                            if you have any suggestions or good ideas for me, let me know.
                        </p>
    
                        <p>Kind regards.</p>
