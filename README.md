# CS50-HarvardCourse
This was my first step into programming, the first programming course I took which introduced me into programming.

The CS50 Course consisted of problem sets every week. The first few weeks were easy but as the course progressed, the problems sets became very challenging. I was able to complete most problem sets, not all.

I done this course in October/November 2020.
